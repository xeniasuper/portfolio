                Interest in technology and human psychology is what brought me to design.
                I am an advocate of socially responsible design based on principles from Design for the Real World by Viktor Papanek.

                            I have a fair knowledge of JavaScript. I've been learning it using
                            <a class="link" href="http://freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>,
                            <a class="link" href="http://codewars.com/" target="_blank">CodeWars</a> and the
                            <a class="link" href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">Eloquent JavaScript</a> book,
                            so I understand all core concepts like closures and OOP in JS. You can find my code on
                            <a class="link" href="http://github.com/xeniasuper" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

                    <p class="skill">I also understand basic stats and have experience with programming in
                        Python. I've completed several courses from

                            this specialization</a> and thus
                        can use Pandas, NumPy, ScyPy and Matplotlib. You can find some examples of my code

                    I finished <a class="link" href="https://lyceum.urfu.ru/" target="_blank">Specialized Educational & Scientific Center of Ural Federal University</a> and then
                    enrolled in Ural Federal University, where I was studying mathematics for about a term.
                    I was performing well, but decided to drop out, because I was dreaming about Moscow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There I went to Russian State University for the Humanities where I was studying applied mathematics and programming
                    to solve problems of the humanities like linguistics and sociology. I passed my first exams with all
                    As and dropped out, because studying there was too easy for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have no problems with self-management, and since then completed several online courses on programming and
                    stats, learned about UX/UI design and got an internship at JetBrains. I also realized that I'm interested in
                    too many things to choose what I would like to study at a uni at this moment.
